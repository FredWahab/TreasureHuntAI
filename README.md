# TreasureHuntAI
A pirate intelligence agent that looks for the treasure in a maze.

This was an assignment from my CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS course where we had to develop an intelligent agent to act as the pirate NPC. This pirate must navigate the game world, which includes various pathways and obstacles, to locate the treasure. The objective for the pirate agent is to find the treasure before the human player does.
