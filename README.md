# TreasureHuntAI
A pirate intelligence agent that looks for the treasure in a maze.

This was an assignment from my CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS course where we had to develop an intelligent agent to act as the pirate NPC. This pirate must navigate the game world, which includes various pathways and obstacles, to locate the treasure. The objective for the pirate agent is to find the treasure before the human player does. I was given two Python classes and the notebook for the assignment. TreasureMaze.py represents the maze environment, while GameExperience.py stores episodes, which are sequences of states from the initial to the terminal state used for the agent's learning through exploration. My task was to complete the deep Q-learning implementation, filling in the code blocks optimizing the agent.

<b>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</b></br>
Computer scientists develop algorithms, design software, and create systems to solve problems, automate tasks, and process data. Their work is crucial for advancing technology, improving efficiency, and enabling innovations across various industries, impacting everyday life and global progress.

<b>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</b></br>
I would approach a problem by clearly defining the issue, breaking it down into manageable components, designing algorithms or models to solve each component, and iteratively testing and refining the solution. This would include researching existing solutions, considering computational efficiency, and ensuring the solution is scalable and maintainable.

<b>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</b></br>
My ethical responsibilities to the end user include ensuring privacy, security, and fairness in technology, avoiding biases in algorithms, and creating accessible and user-friendly systems. Responsibilities to the organization involve maintaining integrity, transparency, and accountability in my work, and ensuring that the technology aligns with ethical standards and legal regulations.
