# TreasureHuntAI
A pirate intelligence agent that looks for the treasure in a maze.

This was an assignment from my CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS course where we had to develop an intelligent agent to act as the pirate NPC. This pirate must navigate the game world, which includes various pathways and obstacles, to locate the treasure. The objective for the pirate agent is to find the treasure before the human player does. I was given two Python classes and the notebook for the assignment. TreasureMaze.py represents the maze environment, while GameExperience.py stores episodes, which are sequences of states from the initial to the terminal state used for the agent's learning through exploration. My task was to complete the deep Q-learning implementation, filling in the code blocks optimizing the agent.
